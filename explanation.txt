I structured the HTML with semantic tags for clarity and accessibility, creating sections like a hero banner, services, 
GitHub projects, testimonials, LinkedIn preview, and footer. A CSS reset ensures consistency, while custom variables manage colors and text sizes. 

The navigation bar is responsive, with a gradient background for larger screens and a burger menu for screens under 500px, implemented with Flexbox and media queries. 

The services section uses Flexbox for centering, proper spacing, and hover effects for interactivity. The GitHub portfolio showcases repositories in 
a responsive grid, dynamically linking to key projects. 

Testimonials were redesigned with card layouts and hover animations for consistency. The LinkedIn section features a responsive card with a profile preview and a 
styled call-to-action button. 

Finally, the footer uses vibrant colors for standout links on a dark background while aligning with the siteâ€™s overall structure and branding.
